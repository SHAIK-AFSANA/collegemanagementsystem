# College Management System 
A college management system project developed using C is a software application designed to streamline administrative tasks in a college or educational institution. This project typically includes features such as student enrollment, course registration, attendance tracking, grade management, and faculty management etc. It allows users to efficiently manage and organize various aspects of college operations. 

## Overview

1. Student Section
2. Courses Section: Displays the courses details of the college. 
3. Staff Section
4. Hostel Section

#### `CollegeHome.c` is the main file. `student.h`, `staff.h`, `courses.h`, `hostel.h`, `placement.h`, `transport.h`, `event.h`, `grading.h`, `attendance.h` are the headerfiles that are included in the main file. These header files contains the logic that dirves you over different sections of College Management System.

  If you haven't already, clone or download the repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can use the git clone command or download the ZIP archive and extract it.
2. **_Open Your Project_** </br>
  Open your IDE or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, DevC++ etc.). Open your College Management System project folder or workspace.
3. **_Set Up Your Project_** </br>
  Ensure that your source code file `CollegeHome.c` (other .c files if you have added any) and header files (.h files) are included in your project.
4. **_Configure Compilation_** </br>
  Check the project settings or build configuration within your IDE/editor to ensure that it is set up to compile and build your project correctly. Specify the main file `CollegeHome.c` as the entry point for compilation.
5. **_Compile Your Project_** </br>
  Use the built-in build or compile command in your IDE/editor. This might be a button, menu option, or keyboard shortcut. The IDE/editor will compile your project, and if there are any errors or warnings, they will be displayed in the console or error window.
6. **_Run Your Program_** </br>
  Once the compilation is successful, you can typically run your program directly from the IDE/editor. Look for a "Run" or "Execute" option.

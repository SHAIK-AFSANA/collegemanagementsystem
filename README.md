  If you haven't already, clone or download the repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can use the git clone command or download the ZIP archive and extract it.
**_Open Your Project_**
  Open your IDE or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, DevC++ etc.). Open your College Management System project folder or workspace.
**_Set Up Your Project_**
  Ensure that all your source code files (including collegehome.c and other .c files) and header files (.h files) are included in your project.
**_Configure Compilation_**
  Check the project settings or build configuration within your IDE/editor to ensure that it is set up to compile and build your project correctly. Specify the main file 'CollegeHome.c' as the entry point for compilation.
**_Compile Your Project_**
  Use the built-in build or compile command in your IDE/editor. This might be a button, menu option, or keyboard shortcut. The IDE/editor will compile your project, and if there are any errors or warnings, they will be displayed in the console or error window.
**_Run Your Program_**
  Once the compilation is successful, you can typically run your program directly from the IDE/editor. Look for a "Run" or "Execute" option.
